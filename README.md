# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This project is designed to deepdive and better understand elements in html and styling in CSS.

This will ensure I am more equipt to move forward with advanced html and CSS techniques.

The Code Refactor was designed to help improve the code for a website.

The requirements were to better structure the code order, replace <div> items in the html with more descriptive elements and review the CSS file with changes to be made where possible in order to streamline functionality.

I have learnt that CSS has a cascade format meaning that inputs take place from top to bottom of the code, there are many elements that are more suitable to <div> and that mistakes appear easily made.

Changes I completed were in multiple commits - I wanted to put some CSS in place for multiple changes at once when elements appeared connected but was confused by the point due to cascading making where ever i put this appear meaningless

html

Added Alt Descriptions.
Removed unrequired img tag.
Changed the title to a more suitable one.
Changed a block of code element to nav that contained links to locations on the page.
Changed <div> of the Header to Header only removing the class element.
Changed a block of code element to article that were describing the company in detail.
Changed the wider block of code <div> containing the articles to section.
Changed the Hero Class <div> to Main as the main image and focus point.
Changed the <div> of the Footer to Footer only removing the class element.
I put back the ID's i removed earlier as i relalised they impacted the navigation.
